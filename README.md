I just want to add additional features that would benefit me and hopefully anyone else who comes across this.

## Contributing
I will be welcoming and encouraging improvements and extra features to the code. If you want to add your own module or fix one of mine, make a PR!
More importantly please support the original creator Puffball101961.
